## Overview

This project aims to develop a holistic sanitation solution using bioethanol-based sanitizer derived from uncultivated plants, promoting environmental sustainability and resource efficiency. By leveraging bioethanol production and automated sanitation methods, the project addresses sanitation challenges while minimizing environmental impact and engaging the community in sustainable practices.

## Key Features

### Bioethanol Production

- **Feedstock:** Utilizes Snakeplant (Dracaena angolensis) extracts for bioethanol production.
- **Process:** Continuous distillation process for efficient bioethanol extraction.
- **Renewable Resource:** Harnesses readily available, uncultivated plants for sustainable bioethanol production.

### Sanitizer Formulation

- **Base:** Bioethanol serves as the primary component of the sanitizer.
- **Fragrance:** Incorporates Lemongrass oil to enhance fragrance and antimicrobial properties.

### Byproduct Utilization

- **Snakeplant Coir:** Repurposed into mats, reducing waste and adding value.
- **Lemongrass Byproduct:** Used as biofuel for cooking, maximizing resource utilization.

### Automated Sanitation

- **Motion Detection:** Sanitizer dispensed automatically upon human motion detection.
- **Efficiency:** Ensures efficient and timely sanitization in high-traffic areas.
